## - Heat Maps & Trajectories

This software is a simple program to create a heatmap for the player positions from the quake 3 engine. 
Currently the files are entered within the code but that will be changed in the future.

This software is able to run from the release exe. so feel free to look at the code or just run it from the exe.

While this is a working piece of software, there are many improvements that will be added over time.

This program has all of the libraries and dll's installed with the files so it can be run anywhere.
